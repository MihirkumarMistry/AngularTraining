## 1. Typescript Basic
In order to enter into the world of Angular application development, typescript is necessary and it is the primary language here. Typescript is a superset of JavaScript. It comes with design-time support which is useful for type safety and tooling. Since, browsers cannot execute the TypeScript directly, it will be ‚ÄòTranspiled‚Äô into JavaScript using the tsc compiler.<br/>
* What is Typescript?
* Benefits of Typescript.
* Setup the Environment.<br/>

## 10. Services
In this module, you will learn about services, In angular services are reusable classes whichcan be injected in components when it's needed. Using a separate service keeps components lean and focused on supporting the view, and makes it easy to unit test components with a mock service
